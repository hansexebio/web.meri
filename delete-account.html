        <h1>Delete Your Meri+ App Account</h1>
        <p>You may choose to permanently delete your Meri+ account and all related data directly from the app. This
            process is immediate and irreversible — once completed, your account cannot be restored.</p>

        <p><strong>To delete your account:</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li>Open the Meri+ app and log in.</li>
            <li>Go to the <strong>Profile</strong> tab and tap <strong>Settings</strong>.</li>
            <li>Select the <strong>General</strong> section.</li>
            <li>Tap on "<strong>Delete account</strong>", confirm, and follow the instructions.</li>
        </ul>

        <div class="note">
            <p><strong>Important information before deleting:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>This action is permanent — your account and all data will be permanently erased.</li>
                <li>Your posts, stories, chats, and personal information will be deleted.</li>
                <li>Any items or features purchased using MeriCoins will not be refunded.</li>
                <li>You must be logged in to perform this action. Guest users or unauthenticated requests cannot delete
                    accounts.</li>
                <li>For your safety, account deletion requests via email or website are not accepted to prevent identity
                    fraud.</li>
            </ul>
