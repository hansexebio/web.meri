        <h1>Commitment to Child Safety</h1>
        <p>
            Our app is intended exclusively for users aged 16 and older. However, we maintain a strong commitment to
            preventing all forms of child sexual abuse and exploitation (CSEA).
        </p>

        <p>As part of our safety policies, we declare the following:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>We strictly prohibit any content involving child sexual abuse or exploitation.</li>
            <li>We use both automated and manual systems to detect, report, and remove content or users who violate this
                policy.</li>
            <li>We cooperate with relevant authorities whenever potential violations are identified.</li>
            <li>We provide accessible reporting tools within the platform so users can safely report inappropriate
                content.</li>
            <li>We regularly train our team to recognize and respond to possible cases of CSEA.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>
            If you encounter any suspicious content or believe a violation of these policies has occurred, please
